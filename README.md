# Azur Lane Fleet Composition
Hey there! I'm *TwinShadow*, or as I'm known on GitHub, *TwinDragon*! Many who know me will know that I play the mobile game Azur Lane and have been since it came out. I also run the guild __Waifu War II__, where it's nothing but floofy touching of all the floofs! My UID for the game is **67138388**, not that anyone will add me. lol... However, I'm always looking for guild mates, so if you happen to be on **Avrora**, by all means come join! Our guild ID: **67109908**.

Down below you'll find a basic table of my current fleet composition of girls I use for the game. I will only list the main fleets of the 4 major factions of the game. It's partly just to keep track of my many fleets, but feel free to take some inspiration for your own fleets.

Each section will also have a dedicated file for which faction they belong in that details what equipment they have equipped, along with images. I might list recommended equipment, but that's for later. Anyway, enjoy the boat girls!

*Note: The first slot will be considered the flagship in the main fleet and command ship of the vanguard. This will be how you add the boats in your fleet basically.*  
*Note 2: Meowfficers will not be included. Their buffs are nice to have, but not an overall factor.*  
*Note 3: **Kai** refers to retrofitting. If you see this, it means they were retrofitted completely.*

| ![Laffey Kai](imgs/USS/LaffeyKaiChibi.png) | Laffey Kai | DD | <details><summary>For a DD, she hits pretty hard.</summary>An AP barrage along with torps? Why not. She also hits hard too and is all-around decent.</details>
| ![Baltimore](imgs/USS/BaltimoreChibi.png) | Baltimore | CA | <details><summary>Hard hitting and CV buffing.</summary>Baltimore hits hard, decent armor, and even buffs your CV's and CVL's in USS fleets.

## Sakura Empire / IJN
### Kitsune
| Chibi | Name | Class | Reason 
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ![Nagato](imgs/IJN/NagatoChibi.png) | Nagato | BB | <details><summary>Glory to the Sakura Empire!</summary>Not only is she a smol fox, she will help you carry your fleet to glory. She has a very powerful barrage if it goes off, and she buffs your IJN carriers to boot. You don't mess with this little thing.</details>
| ![Akagi](imgs/IJN/AkagiChibi.png) | Akagi | CV | <details><summary>You don't take her, you die...</summary>A scary 9-tailed fox that will kill you if you so much as look at another woman... A powerful carrier and when sortied with her sister, Kaga, they buff each other and have an early launch of aircraft. Very formiddable carriers.</details>
| ![Kaga](imgs/IJN/KagaChibi.png) | Kaga | CV | Look at Akagi.

| Chibi | Name | Class | Reason 
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ![Jintsuu Kai](imgs/IJN/JintsuuKaiChibi.png) | Jintsuu Kai | CL | <details><summary>The fox that helps the demon.</summary>Jintsuu buffs all your DD and CL torps while she's afloat, including crits. Pair her up with Ayanami and you've got a force to be reckoned with.</details>
| ![Ayanami Kai](imgs/IJN/AyanamiKaiChibi.png) | Ayanami Kai | DD | <details><summary>*THE* Torp Goddess.</summary>Ayanami is the torpedo goddess of the game, so spec'ing her out accordingly is key. But don't count on those guns of hers. Her barrage also launches powerful torpedoes along with decent self-buffs as well.</details>
| ![Mogami Kai](imgs/IJN/MogamiKaiChibi.png) | Mogami Kai | CA | <details><summary>Better than the Atago sisters.</summary>She makes HE guns actually work in your favor, and has a defense against AP ammo to boot. Hits hard, good armor, good boat to have in your fleet.</details>

## Royal Navy / HMS
### Meido
| Chibi | Name | Class | Reason 
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ![Monarch](imgs/HMS/MonarchChibi.png) | Monarch | BB | <details><summary>Hood, but a BB.</summary>Monarch is basically an AP version of HMS Hood, but in BB form. This requires her to be flagship to make the most use out of her barrage. Otherwise, she hits hard, and hits Sirens harder.</details>
| ![Unicorn](imgs/HMS/UnicornChibi.png) | Unicorn | CVL | <details><summary>The little cutie of healers.</summary>Unicorn is an excellent defense-focused CVL that heals your vanguard every time her aircraft launch.</details>
| ![Illustrious](imgs/HMS/IllustriousChibi.png) | Illustrious | CV | <details><summary>My god those boobs... *cough*</summary>In all seriousness, Illustrious is a defense-oriented CV, having 2 fighter slots and a skill that protects your vanguard from all damage for a few seconds when her aircraft launch.</details>

| Chibi | Name | Class | Reason 
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ![Neptune](imgs/HMS/NeptuneChibi.png) | Neptune | CL | <details><summary>AA for your Queen.</summary>She's got anti-air to back up your fleet from planes. Also, she boosts her own AP shells, so bring those too. And she can self-heal? What's not to like. She's a maid too.</details>
| ![Javelin Kai](imgs/HMS/JavelinKaiChibi.png) | Javelin Kai | DD | <details><summary>She's bringing that bento!</summary>Her Kai really bolstered her where she was just a mediocre ship before. She's also got very high evasion and an AP barrage from her retrofit. And she's cute.</details>
| ![London Kai](imgs/HMS/LondonKaiChibi.png) | London Kai | CA | <details><summary>The maid that boosts FP.</summary>She boosts your entire vanguards firepower by 15%, regardless of faction. Plus, she gets more accurate every time she sinks an enemy.</details>

## Iron Blood / KMS
### Ryuu
| Chibi | Name | Class | Reason 
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ![Ulrich](imgs/KMS/UlrichChibi.png) | Ulrich von Hutten | BB | <details><summary>Somewhat New Jersey for your KMS.</summary>She fires a barrage everytime her main guns fire off, much like New Jersey. On top of that, she hits incredibly hard against others. On top of the other myriad of buffs or debuffs she does, very worthy to have in your fleet.</details>
| ![Peter Strasser](imgs/KMS/Peter_StrasserChibi.png) | Peter Strasser | CV | <details><summary>Slows enemies, and gets KMS buffs.</summary>Peter Strasser may not be in the same light as Graf Zeppelin, but she does get buffs from being in a KMS fleet, and she reduces reload of CV and CVL's for the first 3 rounds. Formiddable in her own right.</details>
| ![Graf Zeppelin](imgs/KMS/Graf_ZeppelinChibi.png) | Graf Zeppelin | CV | <details><summary>The pinnacle of KMS carriers, she helps your vanguard too.</summary>Graf Zeppelin is a good carrier to have. Not only does she buff your vanguard by reducing the damage they take, she gets a buff herself for each KMS ship up to a stack of 3. Equip her with KMS Aircraft and she'll carry you to glory.</details>

| Chibi | Name | Class | Reason 
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ![Leipzig Kai](imgs/KMS/LeipzigKaiChibi.png) | Leipzig Kai | CL | <details><summary>Cruiser buffer, and more speed!</summary>Leipzig buffs your cruisers in the fleet, as well as increasing the speed of your vanguard. On top of this, she'll temporarily evade all enemy fire when her health is low, and a damage buff until the end of the battle.</details>
| ![Z46](imgs/KMS/Z46Chibi.png) | Z46 | DD | <details><summary>Feisty little boat with that barrage of hers.</summary>She's a feisty one, as her AP barrage gets a buff from her skill (but for the love of Cubes, do not equip an AP gun on her; DD's do not like AP guns), and she can hit rapidly too. Oh, and she buffs herself every time she fires down a plane. Buff timer resets every time, but does not stack.</details>
| ![Prinz Heinrich](imgs/KMS/PrinzHeinrichChibi.png) | Prinz Heinrich | CA | <details><summary>Big boat guns.</summary>She's not remarkable, but she gets a self-buff for having another KMS boat in your fleet. And she always fires a barrage every 20 seconds, can't complain there.</details>

## Submarines
*Subs are in a class of their own as they provide supplemental torpedo power. They can help if you have the extra oil to spare. In many cases, their barrages won't matter much, so put your favorite submarine as the first slot if you want.*

*Slower torps are recommended to use because they are more likely to hit than standard. However, if you do face more stationary bosses, then regular torpedoes could, in theory, have higher damage output.*
