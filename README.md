# Azur Lane Fleet Composition
Hey there! I'm *TwinShadow*, or as I'm known on GitHub, *TwinDragon*! Many who know me will know that I play the mobile game Azur Lane and have been since it came out. I also run the guild __Waifu War II__, where it's nothing but floofy touching of all the floofs! My UID for the game is **67138388**, not that anyone will add me. lol... However, I'm always looking for guild mates, so if you happen to be on **Avrora**, by all means come join! Our guild ID: **67109908**.

Down below you'll find a basic table of my current fleet composition of girls I use for the game. I will only list the main fleets of the 4 major factions of the game. It's partly just to keep track of my many fleets, but feel free to take some inspiration for your own fleets.

Each section will also have a dedicated file for which faction they belong in that details what equipment they have equipped, along with images. I might list recommended equipment, but that's for later. Anyway, enjoy the boat girls!

*Note: The first slot will be considered the flagship in the main fleet and command ship of the vanguard. This will be how you add the boats in your fleet basically.*  
*Note 2: Meowfficers will not be included. Their buffs are nice to have, but not an overall factor.*

## Azur Lane / USS
### Enterprise
| Name | Class | Reason 
| --- | --- | --- |
| Alabama | BB | <details><summary>AP Barrage for extra damage.</summary>She hits pretty hard on her own, and along with her AP barrage, there's the added normal firing of shells that can sometimes catch suicide boats.</details>
| Enterprise | CV | <details><summary>She hits **HARD**.</summary>If her skill procs, her aircraft will double their damage output.</details>
| Essex | CV | <details><summary>Protection carrier, and some additional effects.</summary>She provides some pretty good buffs to herself when in a USS fleet, not to mention helping out your ships in certain cases.</details>

| Name | Class | Reason
| --- | --- |
| Laffey | DD | <details><summary>For a DD, she hits pretty hard.</summary>An AP barrage along with torps? Why not. She also hits hard too and is all-around decent.</details>
| Montpelier | CL | <details><summary>Cleveland, but better.</summary>Montpelier is the younger Cleveland-class, improving on her namesake in many ways. She also helps out your other cruisers as well.</details>
| Baltimore | CA | <details><summary>Hard hitting and CV buffing.</summary>Baltimore hits hard, decent armor, and even buffs your CV's and CVL's in USS fleets. If you sortie without them, she'll buff herself instead. Also, she has a special AP ammo buff for her main gun.</details>
