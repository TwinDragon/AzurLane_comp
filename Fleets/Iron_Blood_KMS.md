# Iron Blood Fleets
*You want synergy? They got synergy. Oh, and firepower.. lots and lots of firepower.*

## Regular Fleet Compositions

The German Navy Fleet, *Kriegsmarine* were interesting for their time. Game-wise, they boast some nice firepower, but their torpedoes tend to be lacking that power behind them. To further bolster their forces, many of the boats have synergy between them, buffing their bretheren or bolstering their own defenses or even their offensive capabilities. You can see this clearly with the German u-boats *(for those unaware, `u-boat` is a German submarine)* with their skills intermingling with each other. Only one of them stands out as a Lone Wolf.

The other notable factor of the German ships in Azur Lane is the common theme behind their rigging. Many have the more... "edgy" appearance, or dragon-like. Why this was done I can't say... But, it's a motif that stuck, so who knows.

Me personally, KMS is not my favorite faction. Matter of fact, it's one of my least favorites. Consistently speaking, even with good gear, they don't perform as well I'd like sometimes, so I don't spend a lot of time using them outside of research ships such as Friedrich der Grosse, or Agir and the like. Otherwise, I tend to stick with USS or IJN for most of my gameplay. This also shows in the fact that there simply aren't a lot of good boats for a German fleet, as evidenced by the Fleet Tech level for KMS as the lowest out of all 4 of the major factions. KMS caps out at Level 4, where IJN and USS cap at 9, HMS at 8. They're certainly not well-loved compared to the other factions...
