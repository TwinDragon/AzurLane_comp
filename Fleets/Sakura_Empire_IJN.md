# Sakura Empire Fleets
*The only nation with lots of tails to floof.*

## Regular Fleet Compositions
The fleets below here will constitute various fleets of the Sakura Empire, otherwise known as the Imperial Japanese Navy.

My fleets have a bias towards IJN girls, so y'all are going to see a bit more composition fleets here than you will find from other nations in this repository. It's partly on looks, partly on *LOTS* of tail floof, and also.. **FOXGIRLS**! The main drawback to IJN is that their Anti-Air are typically bad when compared to USS who have arguably the best AA stats in the game, but also to say, KMS or FFNF probably. Either way, enjoy what you see.

*Note: Though minor, some of these may change a tiny bit due to substitutions for Hard maps, or I need specific setups for certain event maps or Operation Siren stuff. I will have a separate table of girls below the main compositions of additional girls I may use depending on circumstances.*

*Note: Yuudachi is a fine DD, but I might end up replacing her for Yukikaze. Will be doing some tests soon-ish.*

## Siren Exterminators
### Main Fleet

| Chibi | Name | Class | Main Gun | Secondary | Anti-Air | Aux 1 | Aux 2

*Note: Maya is alright for a heavy cruiser, but I think I have a candidate to change her out for someone better suited. Going to double check things at a later date and test.*

### Submarine Frenzy

I'm listing submarines as a formality to show what equipment I have on them. I have no real advice on subs as they are only supplemental torpedo damage that do help in some cases to dish out just that extra bit. Read their skills and pick which suit your needs.
