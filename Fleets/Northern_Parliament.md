# Northern Parliament Fleets
*Boats that don't know how to sink.*

## Regular Fleet Compositions

From the frigid waters, these boats don't know when to sink at times. Their torpedoes aren't the best though, and sometimes their rigging show their age. But the staying power these girls have are something else.

I'm not overly familiar with the Russian ships, but from what I have read, the general consensus is they have some good guns, torps are fairly bad, but the skills they have sometimes makes up for a bit of their shortfalls. Most of these ships are from WWI, and the rigging shows at times with their frigid look.

One of the bad things is that there are only 3 BB's, no CV's or even a CVL. That means all you have are going to be a 3 BB backline unlike all other factions. 3 BB's are not ideal fleet compositions, but they can be done. Usually you want at least one CV or CVL to do a screen clear when you need one. Luckily, the staying prowess of these girls may just make up for the lack of a carrier.

## For Mother Russia!
